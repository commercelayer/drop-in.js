# `cl-cart-count`

This component can be used to display the number of items that are in the cart. It fits best inside a `cl-cart-link`, but you free to place it wherever you want.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

Click on this â†’&nbsp;&nbsp;<cl-add-to-cart sku="BACKPACK818488000000XXXX">Add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> and look at the counter.

Here below an example of the same, this time inside a `cl-cart-link` with an svg icon.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={WithIcon} />
</Canvas>

The `cl-cart-count` is shipped without any props, you can preview the styles from [drop-in.css](drop-in.css) by toggling on/off the `styles` property below.

<ArgsTable story='Basic' />
