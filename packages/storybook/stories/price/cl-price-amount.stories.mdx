# Compare-at amount

As you saw in the [**cl-price**](?path=/docs/components-price-cl-price--basic) component examples, `cl-price-amount` is a placeholder used to display the price information.

Each [price](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/prices) has an amount (the actual selling price) and an optional *compare-at* amount (the full price that you want to display to the customer â€” typically with a strikethrough). You can decide which of the two kind of amount to show using the `type` attribute of the component. Give it a try here below: 

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />
