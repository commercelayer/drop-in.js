# `cl-price`

Display a price with localized currency, discounts, and personalization rules.

The `cl-price` component is the owner of the price information.
It has the responsibility to fetch the price of the provided sku and dispatch this information to its [**cl-price-amount**](?path=/docs/components-price-cl-price-amount--basic) children.

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />

### No discount

When there's no discount, the `compare-at` amount will be not displayed.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={NoDiscount} name="No Discount" />
</Canvas>

### No attribute? No content

`code` attribute is mandatory. If you don't set it, the component will be rendered as an empty box without any size.

  <Story story={WithoutAttributes} name="Without Attributes" />
</Canvas>
