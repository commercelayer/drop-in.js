# Price

Once you have correctly set up your organization in Commerce Layer and imported the drop-in library as described [here](?path=/docs/getting-started--page), you can use the `cl-price` component to display the [price](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/prices) of your products with localized currency, discounts, and personalization rules, as shown in the code snippets below.

This component is the owner of the price information. It fetches the price of the specified SKU and dispatches it to the [**cl-price-amount**](?path=/docs/components-price-cl-price-amount--basic) children.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />

### No discount

Each price has an amount (the actual selling price) and an optional *compare-at* amount (the full price that you want to display to the customer â€” typically with a strikethrough). If the latter is not set (i.e. the produce isn't discounted) it won't be displayed, as shown in the example below:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={NoDiscount} name="No Discount" />
</Canvas>

### No product

A price must be associated with a product. That's why the `code` attribute is mandatory. If you don't set it, the component will be rendered as an empty box without any size, as shown in the example below:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={WithoutAttributes} name="No product" />
</Canvas>
