# `cl-price`

Display a price with localized currency, discounts, and personalization rules.

The `cl-price` component is the owner of the price information.
It has the responsibility to fetch the price of the provided sku and dispatch this information to its [**cl-price-amount**](?path=/docs/components-price-cl-price-amount--basic) children.

### No SKU? Empty box

`sku` attribute is mandatory. If you don't set it, the component will be rendered as an empty box without any size.

  <Story story={WithoutAttributes} name="Without Attributes" />
