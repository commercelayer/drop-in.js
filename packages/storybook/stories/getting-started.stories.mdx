# Getting Started

First of all you need to import the `drop-in.js` from the cdn.

Right after that you just need to declare a global variable called `commercelayerConfig`:

| Attribute       | Description                                                                                                 | Type                | Default  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **`clientId`*** | Client ID is the application unique identifier. You can find it in your dashboard.                          | `string`            |          |
| **`slug`***     | Slug for your organization. You can find it in your dashboard. Slug is the subdomain of your base endpoint. | `string`            |          |
| **`scope`***    | Restrict the dataset of your application by specifying allowed scopes. You can find them in your dashboard. | `string`            |          |
| `debug`         | Define the debug level.                                                                                     | `"none"` \| `"all"` | `"none"` |
| `returnUrl`     | Url used in the Hosted Cart to point to "Continue Shopping". This is also used in the thank you page.       | `string`            |          |


The code snippet below should be similar to the final result.

```html dark
<script type="module" src="https://commercelayer.github.io/drop-in.js/dist/drop-in/drop-in.esm.js"></script>

<script>
  (function() {
    window.commercelayerConfig = {
      clientId: 'kuSKPbeKbU9LG9LjndzieKWRcfiXFuEfO0OYHXKH9J8',
      slug: 'drop-in-js',
      scope: 'market:11709',
      debug: 'all', // 'none' is the default
      returnUrl: 'https://example.com' // optional
    }
  }());
</script>
```

## Styling

### `drop-in.css`

This library is shipped unstyled, so that you can apply your own styles. 

If you prefer you can add the following `link` tag:

```html dark
<link href="https://commercelayer.github.io/drop-in.js/dist/drop-in/drop-in.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### `minicart.css`

The [**minicart**](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart--minicart) element works thanks to the css.
**Minicart is unstyled and hidden by default**, so you have to write your own css to style it.

You can start from scratch, or import a minimal set of styles:

```html dark
<link href="https://commercelayer.github.io/drop-in.js/dist/drop-in/minicart.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
