# `Demo` ðŸš€

This is a demo of most of our `drop-in.js` components. We are using Tailwind to speed up the layout building.

We called it demo, but at the end by switching to [live mode](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/api-specification#environments) this can be considered a production website ðŸ˜®.
