# `cl-checkout-link`

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a [hosted version of the Checkout](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-react-checkout#hosted-version) application that is automatically enabled.

You can use the hosted version of the Checkout application with the following URL format: `https://<your-organization-slug>.checkout.commercelayer.app/<order-id>?accessToken=<your-access-token>`

This component can be used as in-place replacement for an `<a>` tag pointing to that url.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

ℹ️ Checkout link is **disabled** when cart does not contain shoppable items.

As soon as you <cl-add-to-cart class="mx-1 px-2 py-1" sku={skus.cap}>add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> a shoppable item, then the checkout link will be cliccable.

<ArgsTable story='Basic' />
