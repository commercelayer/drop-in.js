# `cl-cart-link`

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a [hosted version of the Cart](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cart#hosted-version) application that is automatically enabled.

You can use the hosted version of the Cart application with the following URL format: `https://<your-organization-slug>.commercelayer.app/cart/<order-id>?accessToken=<your-access-token>`

This component can be used as in-place replacement for an `<a>` tag pointing to that url.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story='Basic' />
