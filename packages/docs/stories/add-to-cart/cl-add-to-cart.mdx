# Add to cart

Once you have correctly set up your organization in Commerce Layer and imported the drop-in library as described [here](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs), you can use the `cl-add-to-cart` component to display a buy button on any page with embedded validation rules. By clicking the button, you will be able to add to the shopping cart a specified quantity of a specific product, as shown in the code snippets below.

To enable the buy button, the `quantity` value must be greater than `0`. If the quantity isn't specified the default value will be used and just one unit of the selected product will be added to the shopping cart.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<Controls of={Stories.Basic} />

## Validation rules

As mentioned, the buy button provided by the `cl-add-to-cart` component comes with a set of embedded validation rules, meaning that the button is enabled or disabled based on whether those rules are met or not. Please find here below some common use cases.

### No code

To enable the buy button, you must specify the product you want to add to the shopping cart. That's why the `code` attribute is mandatory. If you don't set it, the button will be rendered as disabled, as shown in the example below:

<Canvas of={Stories.WithoutAttributes} />

### Out of stock

<p>
The <code>cl-add-to-cart</code> component checks the inventory for the product identified by the provided code. If it is out of stock (e.g. <code>{codes.outOfStock}</code>) the button will be rendered as disabled, as shown in the example below:
</p>

<Canvas of={Stories.OutOfStock} />

### Non-existing code

<p>
The provided code must exist among the products of your organization. If you set as the <code>code</code> attribute a non-existing one (e.g. <code>{codes.nonexisting}</code>) the button will be rendered as disabled, as shown in the example below:
</p>

<Canvas of={Stories.Nonexisting} />

### Overselling prevention

<p>
  In order to prevent overselling errors, the <code>cl-add-to-cart</code> component won't let you add to the shopping cart a quantity of the selected product greater than the available one, as shown in the example below where the product with code <code>{codes.noOverselling}</code> has less than <code>100</code> stock units, and so the button is rendered as disabled:
</p>

<Canvas of={Stories.OversellingPrevention} />

### Virtually infinite stock

<p>
  Some products (e.g.<code>{codes.doNotTrack}</code>) can be assigned a virtually infinite stock (to do that, you just need to set the <code>do_not_track</code> attribute of the SKU to <code>true</code>). In this case, the component will let you add as many units as you want and the button will be rendered as enabled for any value of the  <code>quantity</code> attribute (as long as it's greater than  <code>0</code>), as shown in the example below:
</p>

<Canvas of={Stories.DoNotTrack} />

## Events

The `cl-add-to-cart` component triggers the [**cl-cart-additem**](?path=/docs/events--docs#cl-cart-additem) custom event when an item is added to the cart and the [**cl-skus-getsku**](?path=/docs/events--docs#cl-skus-getsku) custom event when an SKU is fetched.
