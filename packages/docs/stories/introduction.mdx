# Commerce Layer micro frontends

Commerce Layer [drop-in.js](https://github.com/commercelayer/drop-in.js) lets you transform any plain HTML page into an enterprise-grade static commerce website, with almost no coding required, thanks to a set of [micro frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) (MFEs) that handle the main ecommerce functionalities. Commerce Layer micro frontends are framework-agnostic, standard [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components): a collection of reusable micro experiences that you can embed in multiple websites and share across different projects.

Prices, availability messages, shopping cart, and more are automatically mixed into your own content and styling, whatever the CMS, SSG, and tools you use to build your site pages. All you need to do is embed the library as explained [here](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs) and add tags to the HTML page. The available web components provided by the library are listed below.

## Components

<div className="link-list">
  <Card title="Price" icon="price" onClick={linkTo('components-price-cl-price--docs')}>
    Display a price with localized currency, discounts, and personalization rules.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Availability" icon="availability" onClick={linkTo('components-availability-cl-availability--docs')}>
    Display an availability message with localized delivery lead time and cost.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Add to cart" icon="add-to-cart" onClick={linkTo('components-add-to-cart-cl-add-to-cart--docs')}>
    Add a buy button to any page with embedded validation rules.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cart" icon="cart" onClick={linkTo('components-cart-cl-cart--docs')}>

  </Card>

## Demo ðŸš€

If you want to see most of the reusable components above in action before digging into the details, check this simple product landing page. Feel free to take a look at the code by clicking on the *Show code* button to see how straightforward it is. Toggle the related switch in the header to activate/deactivate the components [styling](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs#styling) (we are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to speed up the layout building).

We've called it a demo, but the truth is that by switching the linked organization [from test to live mode](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/api-specification#environments) on the Commerce Layer Admin Dashboard, this can be considered a full-fledged, up and running production website ðŸ˜® â€” and it took a snap to build it!
