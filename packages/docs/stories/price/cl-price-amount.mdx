# Price amounts

As you saw in the [`cl-price`](?path=/docs/components-price-cl-price--docs) component examples, `cl-price-amount` is a placeholder used to display the price information.

Each [price](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/prices) has an amount (the actual selling price) and an optional *compare-at* amount (the full price that you want to display to the customer â€” typically with a strikethrough). You can define which of the two kind of amount to show by using the `type` attribute of the component. Give it a try here below: 

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<Controls of={Stories.Basic} />
