# Shopping cart

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a hosted version of the [open-source Cart application](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cart) that is automatically enabled. It's a React-based implementation that provides you with a production-ready shopping cart powered by Commerce Layer APIs.

Once you have correctly set up your organization in Commerce Layer and imported the drop-in library as described [here](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs), you can use the `cl-cart` component to embed the Commerce Layer Cart in your own shopping cart page instead of redirecting the user outside of your website.

The component works in the most straightforward way, as shown in the code snippet below. Just click on <cl-add-to-cart class="mx-1 px-2 py-1" code={codes.available}>add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> and see what happens:

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

{/* <Controls of={Stories.Basic} /> */}

  Yes, the in-line button was *dropped in* the sentence above using the [`cl-add-to-cart`](?path=/docs/components-add-to-cart-cl-add-to-cart--docs) component. Pretty cool, huh? ðŸ˜Ž

### Minicart

You can use the `cl-cart` component inside a [`cl-cart-link`](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart-link--docs) one to make it act as a [minicart](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart-minicart--docs).
