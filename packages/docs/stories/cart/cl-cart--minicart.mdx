# Minicart

The [**cl-cart**](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart--docs) component acts as a minicart when rendered inside a [**cl-cart-link**](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart-link--docs) one. With this feature, you can offer your customers a familiar UI experience where the cart slides in on click (or as soon as you add an item) and overlays the page, giving them an overview of the cart summary and the possibility to checkout, as shown in the code snippet below.

Please note that the minicart is unstyled and hidden by default. You have to write some CSS from scratch in order to make it work as you need. Otherwise, you can import the [**minicart.css**](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs#minicartcss) file into your website, using it as is or as a reference to tweak at your leisure.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<ArgsTable story="Basic" include={['open-on-add']} />

Want to see the `open-on-add` feature in action? Set the related attribute to `true` and click on <cl-add-to-cart class="mx-1 px-2 py-1" code={codes.available}>add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> once again. ðŸ˜‰
