# Shopping cart link

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a hosted version of the [open-source Checkout application](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cart) that is automatically enabled. It's a React-based implementation that provides you with a production-ready shopping cart powered by Commerce Layer APIs. Developers can integrate it with just a single URL link as explained in detail [here](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cart#hosted-version).

Once you have [imported](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs) the drop-in library, you can use the `cl-cart-link` component as an in-place replacement for an `<a>` tag pointing to that URL with the option to specify the `target`, as shown in the code snippet below.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<ArgsTable story='Basic' />

### Custom icon

Instead of a simple text link, you can use any custom icon, as shown in the example below:

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIcon} />

### Minicart

You can use the `cl-cart-link` to wrap a [**cl-cart**](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart--docs) one and make it act as a [**minicart**](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart-minicart--docs).
