# `cl-cart-count`

This component can be used to display the number of items that are in the cart. It fits best inside a `cl-cart-link`, but you free to place it wherever you want.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

Click on <cl-add-to-cart class="mx-1 px-2 py-1" code={codes.available}>add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> and look at the counter.

<ArgsTable story='Basic' exclude={['Use drop-in.css']} />

Here below an example of the same, this time inside a `cl-cart-link` with an svg icon.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={WithIcon} />
</Canvas>

And another one with simply a text.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={WithText} />
</Canvas>

The `cl-cart-count` is shipped without any props, you can preview the styles from [drop-in.css](drop-in.css) by toggling on/off the `styles` property below.

<ArgsTable story='Basic' include={['Use drop-in.css']} />

### Styling with `<a>`

The component `cl-cart-link` automatically generates the url to point to the hosted cart.

But what if you want to point to your internal cart page? You can simply use an `<a>` tag and add the `cl-cart-link` class to it.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={LinkWithStyle} />
</Canvas>
