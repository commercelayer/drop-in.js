# Shopping cart

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a hosted version of the [open-source Cart application](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cart) that is automatically enabled. It's a React-based implementation that provides you with a production-ready shopping cart powered by Commerce Layer APIs.

Once you have correctly set up your organization in Commerce Layer and imported the drop-in library as described [here](?path=/docs/getting-started--page), you can use the `cl-cart` component to embed the Commerce Layer Cart in your own shopping cart page instead of redirecting the user outside of your website.

The component works in the most straightforward way, as shown in the code snippet below. Just click on <cl-add-to-cart class="mx-1 px-2 py-1" code={codes.available}>add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> and see what happens:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Basic} name="Basic" />
</Canvas>

Just in case you were wondering â€” yes, the in-line button was *dropped in* the sentence above using the [**cl-add-to-cart**](?path=/docs/components-add-to-cart-cl-add-to-cart--basic) component). Pretty cool, huh? ðŸ˜Ž

### Minicart

The `cl-cart` component acts as a minicart when rendered inside a [**cl-cart-link**](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart-link--basic) one. With this feature, you can offer your customers a familiar UI experience where the cart slides in on click (or as soon as you add an item) and overlays the page, giving them an overview of the cart summary and the possibility to checkout, as shown in the code snippet below.

Please note that the minicart provided by the `cl-cart` component is unstyled and hidden by default. You have to write some CSS from scratch in order to make it work as you need. Otherwise, you can import the [**minicart.css**](?path=/docs/getting-started--page#minicartcss) file into your website, using it as is or as a reference to tweak at your leisure.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story story={Minicart} name="Minicart" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Minicart" />

Want to see the `open-on-add` feature in action? Set the related attribute to `true` and click on <cl-add-to-cart class="mx-1 px-2 py-1" code={codes.available}>add to cart</cl-add-to-cart> once again. ðŸ˜‰
