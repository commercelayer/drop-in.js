# Delivery and shipping information

As you saw in the [**cl-availability**](?path=/docs/components-availability-cl-availability--docs) component examples, `cl-availability-info` is a placeholder used to display the availability information in terms of delivery lead times, shipping methods, and related costs.

You can choose which kind of data you want to show by using the `type` attribute of the component. If the selected product is out of stock, no information will be displayed and the component will be rendered as an empty box without any size. Give it a try here below:

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<Controls of={Stories.Basic} />

### Multiple information

You can combine different `cl-availability-info` types to compose the custom message that fits your needs, as shown in the example below:

<Canvas of={Stories.Message} />
