# Availability status

As you saw in the [**cl-availability**](?path=/docs/components-availability-cl-availability--docs) component examples, `cl-availability-status` is a placeholder used to display the availability status.

The inner message will be displayed based on the status type. If the `type` attribute is set to `available`, the message will be visible only if the product is available. Vice versa, if it is set to `unavailable`, the message will be visible only if the product is out of stock. Give it a try here below by playing with different combinations of the *Use an available product toggle* and the `type` attribute selector:

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />
