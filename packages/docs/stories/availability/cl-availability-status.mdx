# Availability status

As you saw in the [`cl-availability`](?path=/docs/components-availability-cl-availability--docs) component examples, `cl-availability-status` is a placeholder used to display the availability status.

The inner message will be displayed based on the status type. If the `type` attribute is set to `available`, the message will be visible only if the product is available. Vice versa, if it is set to `unavailable`, the message will be visible only if the product is out of stock. You can also set it to `available-with-info` in case you need to show additional information (if present) about the product availability (e.g. estimated delivery dates, shipping costs, etc.). In this case, the message will be visible only if the product is available and the related shipments come with available shipping methods that have delivery lead times specified. Give it a try here below by playing with different combinations of the *Product availability* and the `type` attribute selectors:

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<Controls of={Stories.Basic} />
