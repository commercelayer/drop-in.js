# My account

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a hosted version of the [open-source My account application](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-my-account) that is automatically enabled. It's a React-based, production-ready reserved user area with order history and address management features that developers can integrate with just a single URL link as explained in detail [here](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-my-account#hosted-version).

Once you have [imported](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs) the drop-in library, you can use the `cl-my-account-link` component as an in-place replacement for an `<a>` tag pointing to that URL with the option to specify the `target`, as shown in the code snippet below.
