# Identity status

The `cl-identity-status` is a placeholder used to [display specific content](#mutually-exclusive-content) depending on whether the user is logged in or not.

The inner message will be displayed based on the status type, matched against the currently stored access token. If the `type` attribute is set to `customer`, the message will be visible only to logged users. Vice versa, if it is set to `guest`, the message will be visible only to non-logged users. Give it a try here below:

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

<Controls of={Stories.Basic} />

### Mutually exclusive content

Using two instances of the `cl-identity-status` with different `type` you can you can show different editorial content to logged customers than what you show to guests, as shown in the snippet below:

<Canvas of={Stories.Message} />

<Alert title="Try it out!" type="success">
  <cl-identity-link class="font-bold text-[#1EA7FD]" type="logout" target="_parent">Logout</cl-identity-link> first (if you were already logged in) and then <cl-identity-link class="font-bold text-[#1EA7FD]" type="login" target="_blank">login</cl-identity-link> again (guess what? Both links were *dropped in* this sentence using the [**cl-identity-link**](?path=/docs/components-identity-cl-identity-link--docs) component). ðŸ˜‰.
