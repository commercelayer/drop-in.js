# Getting started

Assuming you already have a Commerce Layer account ([sign up](https://dashboard.commercelayer.io/sign_up) if you don't — it's free!) and your organization properly set up and filled with real or sample data (check our [onboarding documentation](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/welcome) for more information about that), you can get easily started with Commerce Layer `drop-in.js` in two simple steps:

1. Import the library from the [CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@commercelayer/drop-in.js@2/dist/drop-in/drop-in.esm.js).
2. Declare a global variable called `commercelayerConfig` and set the following attributes.

| Attribute                   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------|:--------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`clientId`**              | String |     ✓    | Your [sales channel](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/api-credentials#sales-channel) client ID. You can find it in your API credential details page on your dashboard.                                                                                     |
| **`scope`**                 | String |     ✓    | Your sales channel [scope](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/authentication#authorization-scopes) (use it to restrict the dataset of your application). You can find the allowed scopes in your API credential details page on your dashboard.              |
| `debug`                     | String |          | The debug level. Can be one of `none` or `all`. Default is `none`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `storageOrderKeySuffix`     | String |          | The suffix appended to the storage key for the order. This is especially useful for differentiating carts when the `clientId` and `scope` are the same. When set, the storage key follows this format: `commercelayer_order-id-<clientId>-<scope>-<suffix>`. |
| `defaultAttributes.orders`  | Object |          | Default [attributes](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/api-reference/orders/object) when creating an `orders` resource type. See the snippet below for a working example.                                                                                   |


The final result should be similar to the code snippet below:

<Source language='html' dark code={`
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@commercelayer/drop-in.js@2/dist/drop-in/drop-in.esm.js"></script>

<script>
  window.commercelayerConfig = {
    clientId: 'kuSKPbeKbU9LG9LjndzieKWRcfiXFuEfO0OYHXKH9J8',
    scope: '${getSelectedScopeValue()}',
    debug: 'all', // default is 'none'
    defaultAttributes: {
      orders: {
        /**
         * The preferred language code (ISO 639-1) to be used when communicating with the customer.
         * If the language is supported, the hosted checkout will be localized accordingly.
         * @default 'en'
         */
        language_code: 'en',
        /**
         * The URL the cart's *Continue shopping* button points to. This is also used in the thank you page.
         * @optional
         */
        return_url: 'https://example.com'
      }
    }
  }
</script>
`} />

## Micro frontends configuration

Our hosted micro frontend applications can be forked and configured independently.

The Provisioning API allows you to partially configure them at the organization level by properly passing the `mfe` object in the `config` attribute.
For more information, please refer to [our documentation](https://docs.commercelayer.io/provisioning/api-reference/organizations#micro-frontends-configuration).

## Styling

### `drop-in.css`

The drop-in library is shipped unstyled, so that you can apply your own styles. We provide some simple styling. If you're happy with that or you just want to speed up the set up process just add an additional `link` tag to your HTML code as follows:

<Source language='html' dark code={`
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@commercelayer/drop-in.js@2/dist/drop-in/drop-in.css" rel="stylesheet" />
`} />

### `minicart.css`

The [minicart](?path=/docs/components-cart-cl-cart-minicart--docs) version of the cart is unstyled and hidden by default. Since its behavior is achieved mostly via CSS, you have to write your own to style it. You can start from scratch, or import a minimal set of styles and take it from there. To do that, just add an additional `link` tag to your HTML code as follows:

<Source language='html' dark code={`
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@commercelayer/drop-in.js@2/dist/drop-in/minicart.css" rel="stylesheet" />
`} />
