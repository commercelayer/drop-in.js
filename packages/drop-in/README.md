# Commerce Layer drop-in library

Commerce Layer `drop-in.js` lets you transform any plain HTML page into an enterprise-grade static commerce website, with almost no coding required, thanks to a set of micro frontends that handle the main ecommerce functionalities.

Prices, availability messages, shopping bag, and more are automatically mixed into your own content and styling, whatever the CMS, SSG, and tools you use to build your site pages. All you need to do is embed the library and add tags to the HTML page.
