# drop-in.js

Commerce Layer drop-in.js lets you transform any plain HTML page into an enterprise-grade static commerce website, with almost no coding required. All you need to do is embed the library and add tags to the HTML page.

Prices, availability messages, shopping bag, and any other commerce functionality are automatically mixed into your own content and styling, whatever the CMS, SSG, and tools you use to build your site pages.
